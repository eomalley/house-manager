# house-manager
Manages the inventory of a home, assuming you take the time to do lots of data entry. Requires a derby db. 

This is PRETTY OLD (AngularJS, some old version of boot, etc) and I haven't really thought to update it. Put it here as a, "maybe one day I will" sort of thing, and was tired of passing it to different computer workspaces uses my gmail account. Would like to update it to a current version of spring boot & Angular 2 (w/ cli, probably).
